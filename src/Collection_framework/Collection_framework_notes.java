/*     COLLECTIONS FRAMEWORK !!
A collection represents a group of object java collections provide classes and interfaces for us to be able
to write code quickly and efficiently.

        WHY DO WE NEED COLLECTIONS .???
we need collections for efficient storage and better manipulation of data in java .
for eg :- we need array to store integer values ; but what if we want to : -
1) Resize this  Array ?
2) Insert an element in between .
3) Delete an element in array
4) Apply certain operations to change this array .
    Collection in java are available for classes and interfaces .

    common collections classes used in java are :
 1) Arraylist :-  for variable size collection .
 2) Set :-  for distinct collection
 3) Stack :-  A LIFO data structure
 4) HashMap :- for storing key-value pairs.

        Collections are available in java.util.collection package .
